| 3  | Visualization Caption | Comparison of dimensionality reduction algorithms on synthetic data: (a) Explained variance as the number of principal components increases from 2 to 8, and (b) Mean F-score across 10 trials for varying noise levels (0.2 to 1.4).|
| 4  | Plotting Data         | [vari2.mat](vari2.mat) and [F_score.mat](F_score.mat)                                                                       |

| 7  | Natural Language Request | For the given data, create two line plots: (a) Explained Variance vs. Number of Principal Components, (b) F-score vs. Noise Variance, comparing methods like PCA+ICA, SPCA+ICA, PMD, GPOWER, DPCA1a (proposed), DPCA1b (proposed), and DPCA2 (proposed) |
